    "This chapter introduces statistical hypothesis testing, which is such a contentious topic in the history of statistics, it's hard to provide a simple definition.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Advantage: The standard statistics curriculum includes many different tests, and many people find it hard to remember which one to use. In my opinion, simulation makes it clearer that there is only one testing framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Advantage: Simulations make modeling decision explicit.  All statistical methods are based on models, but when we use mathematical methods, it is easy to forget the assumptions they are based on. With computation, the assumptions are more visible, and it is easier to try different models.\n",

Remarkably, only 3% of the children who were randomized to eating the peanut snack developed allergy by age 5. Therefore, in high-risk infants, sustained consumption of peanut beginning in the first 11 months of life was highly effective in preventing the development of peanut allergy."

As an exercise, you tested the difference in weight between first babies and others.\n",

We used permutation to model the null hypothesis and the estimated slope as a test statistic.\n",
